# Introduction 
* I'll be working on __Sean Lahman__'s database about baseball teams to get some insights about the data (Ex: Team's __spendings__ and __winning rate__ and their relation...etc). Exploring basic Data Science techniques like (Data Wrangling - Exploratory Data Analysis - Data Transformations).<br> 

## A Bit of Background 
* In Major League Baseball, A game is usually composed of 9 innings, an __inning__ in baseball is the basic unit of play, consisting of 2 halves or frames: the __"top"__ (first half) and the __"bottom"__ (second half). In each half, one team bats until three outs are made, with the other team playing defense.<br> 
* The team with the __greater number of runs__ at the end of the game __wins__. If scores are __tied__ at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played.<br> 
* Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning. <br>
* In principle, better players are more expensive, so teams that want good players need to spend more money. __Does Teams that spend the most, frequently win the most?__

### Question 
* __Can a team that does not spend much money achieve a good winning rate?__

### Database
* [lahman2014](https://github.com/jknecht/baseball-archive-sqlite/raw/master/lahman2014.sqlite) <br>
* I will be using __Salaries__ and __Teams__ tables of the database throughout the project.
